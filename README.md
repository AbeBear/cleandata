=========================================
'run_analysis.R'
R code with function run_analysis() that creates new dataset
with the average value of the measurements group by activity
or subject.  The new dataset is found in the created file 
'UCI HAR Averages.csv'.  Activity and subject are listed in 
separate columns for clarity.  New column labels are created 
in order to have more tidy data.  For more information on
the labels, I direct you to the link above.
